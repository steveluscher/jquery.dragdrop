# jquery.dragdrop [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/steveluscher/jquery.dragdrop.png)](https://travis-ci.org/steveluscher/jquery.dragdrop)

You are looking at a developmental version of jQuery DragDrop. This library is not yet ready for use.

This project is distinct from jQuery UI Draggable/Droppable in its approach. jQuery UI implements a drag manager that performs collision detection between objects as you drag. The primary benefit of this approach is the ability to specify various [collision modes](http://api.jqueryui.com/droppable/#option-tolerance), such as “fit,” “intersect,” and “touch.”

The cost of implementing a drag manager to support those collision modes is massive.

|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Drop zones are z-index stackable                                  | :no_entry_sign: | :+1:            |
| Draggables and drop zones can be transformed using CSS Transforms | :no_entry_sign: | :+1:            |

jQuery DragDrop trades sophisticated collision detection for performance, simplicity, and durability.
